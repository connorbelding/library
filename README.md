# library
A library app made with JS

This project involves a lot of modifying an array (the library books array) and reflecting those changes onto the HTML by modifying, deleting, and adding new elements.  I used the module pattern for handling fetching elements and creating the elements of a book.  This helps keep code out of the top-level scope.
